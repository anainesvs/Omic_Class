#### (1) Installing BGLR
The code below illustrates how to install and load the necessary package from CRAN using `install.packages()`.
```R
   install.packages(pkg='BGLR')    # install BGLR
   library(BGLR); 
```  

#### (2) Loading data
**Data**: The data can be obtained from NIH/NCI at: [https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov]
The code assumes that the user starts with data in a file `OMIC_DATA_class.rda` 
the objects that contain the phenotypic information, clinical covariates, and omic data. 
The code assumes that the file `OMIC_DATA.rda` contain the following objects:
   * `XF`: an incidence matrix for clinical covariates.
   * `Xge`: an incidence matrix for gene expression. 
   * `Xmt`: an incidence matrix for methylation values at various sites of chromosome 21 (only).
   * `y`: a matrix with an id, pathologic N, time to last follow up and alive status at the last follow up (0: alive, 1:death).
The code below assumes that all the predictors were edited by removing outliers 
and predictors that did not vary in the sample, transformed if needed, and 
missing values were imputed.

#### (3) Clinical Covariates.
The following covariates are available: 
Race/ethnic group:  latino, african 
Age at diagnosis: age 
Cancer stage: PatStage 
Cancer histological type, specifically if the cancer is located in the lobular tissue: is_lobCarc 
Pathological Tumor stage (indicating tumor size): patT 
Pathological Nodal status: patN 
Pathologic N scores the degree of spread to regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. 
    N0: tumor cells absent from regional lymph nodes
    N1: regional lymph node metastasis present; (at some sites: tumor spread to closest or small number of regional lymph nodes)
    N2: tumor spread to an extent between N1 and N3 (N2 is not used at all sites)
    N3: tumor spread to more distant or numerous regional lymph nodes (N3 is not used at all sites)

Breast cancer subtypes can be defined with ERp, PRp and HER. 
The indicator variables showing results of positive status or unknown status (test not run or inconslusive results) are: 
ERp, ERuk, PRp, PRuk, HER, and HERuk
We will write the following groups: 

```R 
luminal<-         which( (XF[,"ERp"]==1 | XF[,"PRp"]==1) & XF[,"HER"]==0)
triplenegative<-  which( XF[,"ERp"]==0 & XF[,"PRp"]==0 & XF[,"HER"]==0)
her2p <-          which( XF[,"HER"]==1)
```R 

#### (4) Computing similarity matrices
 In this lab we will incorporate omics by incorporating correlated random effects. 
 For this, we will compute similarity between tumors in the methylation omic set and similarites in GE patterns with matrices of the form G= X * t(X) 
  computed from omics. The following code illustrates (3.a) editions necessary to perform before computing the similarity matrices, (3.b) code to compute this matrix.
 A similar code could be use to compute a G-matrix for gene expression, microRNA or other omics (see (6)).
 
 (4.a)  Exploring the methylation data
  1. Look at the data
  2. Study if there are missing values
  3. See if there is methylation sites that are constants
  4. Compute number of missing CpG sites per subject, remove sub >20% missing values
  5. Imputation of missing values
  6. Scale, centering, of distance between subjects (G)

```R 
#1
plot(Xmt[,1], type='l', col='gray', ylim=c(0,1))
for(i in 2:20){ lines(Xmt[,i], type='l', col=sample(1:20)) ; Sys.sleep(1)}

#2
namth<-sdmth<-numeric(ncol(Xmt))
for(i in 1:ncol(Xmt)){namth[i]<-sum(is.na(Xmt[,i]))}
hist(namth)

#3 Rm CpG sites that are constant
for(i in 1:ncol(Xmt)){sdmth[i]<-sd(Xmt[,i],na.rm=TRUE)} 
hist(sdmth)
Xmt<-Xmt[,sdmth>0.01]

#4 identify subjects with problematic assays
namth<-numeric(nrow(Xmt))
for(i in 1:nrow(Xmt)){namth[i]<-sum(is.na(Xmt[,i]))}
any(  (namth/ncol(Xmt)) >0.2 )

#5 naive imputation imputing mean of the CpG sites
for(i in 1:ncol(Xmt)){Xmt[,i]<-ifelse(is.na(Xmt[,i]), mean(Xmt[,i],na.rm=TRUE), Xmt[,i])}
any(is.na(Xmt))
```

(4.b)  Look and edit if needed Gene Expression data. The following code shows how to compute a similarity matrix for gene expression, please also do one for methylation called Gmt.

 ```R 
  #Computing a similarity matrix for gene-expression data
   Xge<- scale(Xge, scale=TRUE, center=TRUE) #centering and scaling
   Gge<-tcrossprod(Xge)                      #computing crossproductcts
   Gge<-Gge/mean(diag(Gge))                  #scales to an average diagonal value of 1.
```
**NOTE**: for larger data sets it may be more convinient to use the `getG()` function of the [BGData](https://github.com/quantgen/BGData) R-package. This function allows computing G without loading all the data in RAM and offers methods for multi-core computing. 





#### (5)  Fitting a binary regression for (the "fixed effects" of) Clinical Coavariates using BGLR (COV)
The following code illustrates how to use BGLR to fit a fixed effects model. The matrix XF is an incidence matrix for clinical covariates. There is no column for intercept in XF because BGLR adds the intercept automatically. The response variable `y` is assumed to be coded with two lables (e.g., 0/1), the argument `response_type` is used to indicate to BGLR that the response is ordinal (the binary case is a special case with only two levels). Predictors are given to BGLR in the form a two-level list. The argument `save_at` can be used to provide a path and a pre-fix to be added to the files saved by BGLR. For further details see [PÃ©rez-Rodriguez and de los Campos, Genetics, 2014](http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/198/2/483.full.pdf). The code also shows how to retrieve estimates of effects and of success probabilities. In the examples below we fit the model using the default number of iterations (1,500) and burn-in (500). In practice longer chains are needed, the user can increase the numbrer of iterations or the burn-in using the arguments `nIter` and `burnIn` of `BGLR`.
```R
### Inputs
# centering and scaling the incidence matrix for fixed effects.
 XF<- scale(XF, scale=FALSE, center=TRUE) 
 ETA.COV<-list( COV=list(X=XF, model='FIXED') )
# Fitting the model
 fm=BGLR(y=y, ETA=ETA.COV, saveAt='cov_', response_type='ordinal')
# Retrieving estimates
 fm$ETA$COV$b      # posterior means of fixed effects
 fm$ETA$COV$SD.b   # posteriro SD of fixed effects
 head(fm$probs)    # estimated probabilities for the 0/1 outcomes.
```

#### (5)  Fitting a binary model for fixed effects and whole genome gene expression (GE) using BGLR (COV+GE)
The following code illustrates how to use BGLR to fit a mixed effects model that accomodates both clinical covariates and whole-genome-gene expression. 
```R
# Setting the linear predictor
  ETA.COV.GE<-list( COV=list(X=XF, model='FIXED'), GE=list(K=Gge, model='RKHS'))
# Fitting the model
  fm.COV.GE<- BGLR(y=y, ETA=ETA.COV.GE, response_type='ordinal',saveAt='cov_ge_')
#  Retrieving predictors
  fm.COV.GE$mu            # intercept
  fm.COV.GE$ETA$COV$b     # effects of covariates
  fm$COV.GE$ETA$GE$varU   # variance associated to GE SD.varU gives posterior SD
  fm.COV.GE$ETA$GE$u      # random effects associated to gene expression
  plot(scan('cov_ge_ETA_GE_varU.dat'),type='o',col=4) # trace plot of variance of GE.
```
**NOTE**: to fit a similar model for COV+METH one just needs to change the inputs in the defintiion of the linear predictor by providing Gmt instead of Gge.

#### (6)  Fitting a binary model for fixed effects covariates and 2 omics (COV+GE+METH)
The following code shows how to extend the the model `COV+GE` with addition of methylation data.
```R
#Computing a similarity matrix for methylation data
Xmt<- scale(Xmt, scale=TRUE, center=TRUE)  #centering and scaling
Gmt<-tcrossprod(Xmt)                       #computing crossproductcts
Gmt<-Gmt/mean(diag(Gmt))                   #scales to an average diagonal value of 1.
ETA.COV.GE.MT<-list( COV=list(X=XF, model='FIXED'),
                     GE=list(K=Gge, model='RKHS'),
                     METH=list(K=Gmt, model='RKHS'))
# Fitting models 
fm.COV.GE.MT<- BGLR(y=y, ETA=ETA.COV.GE.MT, 
                 response_type='ordinal',saveAt='cov_ge_mt_')
```

#### (7)  Fitting a binary model for fixed effects covariates and 2 omics and their interactions (COV+GE+METH+GExMETH)
The following code shows how to extend the the model `COV+GE+METH` with addition of interactions between gene expression and methylation profiles.
```R
 G.mg=Gmt*Gge
 G.mg=G.mg/mean(diag(G.mg))
 ETA.COV.GE.MT.GExMT<-list( COV=list(X=XF, model='FIXED'),
                     GE=list(K=Gge, model='RKHS'),
                     METH=list(K=Gmt, model='RKHS'),
                     GExMETH=list(K=G.mg, model='RKHS'))
# Fitting models 
fm.COV.GE.MT.GExMT<- BGLR(y=y, ETA=ETA.COV.GE.MT.GExMT, 
                 response_type='ordinal',saveAt='cov_ge_mt_gexmt')
```

#### (8) Validation
The following illustrates how to select a validation set using the model `COV` as example.
```R
#Installing and loading library pROC to compute Area Under the ROC Curve.
install.packages(pkg='pROC')    # install pROC
library(pROC);
n <- length(y)
  # Randomly select a 20% of the data to be the testing set 
tst<- runif(n) <0.2
yNA = y; yNA[tst] <-NA
  # Fit the model only in the training set
fm.COVtr<- BGLR(y=yNA, ETA=ETA.COV, response_type='ordinal')
  # Find probability of survival for the testing set
pred <-fm.COVtr$probs[tst,2]
  # Estimate AUC
AUC_train<-auc(y[!tst],fm.COVtr$yHat[!tst])
AUC_test<-auc(y[tst], pred)
#For the first individual, area under the standard normal curve (CDF) 
#of estimated y from full model:
pnorm(fm.COVtr$yHat[1])
```
**NOTE**: if sample size is small (like TCGA data) and uneven in the number of 1s and 0s it will be wise to randomize 1s and 0s to be part of the testing sets, and repeate the validation multiple times. In Vazquez et al., 2016 (Genetics) we implement 200 cross-validations.
